# TWRP device tree for OnePlus 7T Pro (hotdog)

## Disclaimer - Unofficial TWRP!

These are personal test builds of mine. In no way do I hold responsibility if it/you messes up your device.
Proceed at your own risk.

## Compile

Setup repo tool from here https://source.android.com/setup/develop#installing-repo

To build, execute these commands in order

```
source build/envsetup.sh
export ALLOW_MISSING_DEPENDENCIES=true
export LC_ALL=C
lunch twrp_hotdog-eng
mka adbd recoveryimage
```

To test it:

```
# To temporarily boot it
fastboot boot out/target/product/hotdog/recovery.img 

# Since 7T / Pro has a dedicated recovery partition, you can flash the recovery with
fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
```
